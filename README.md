# Box of Kittens

Game: Help the mother cat find her kittens.

### 🌈 Game World 
This world contains three large cat families: Red, Green, and Blue.  
Each family has cats and kittens of different colors, but each family has a single primary color.

### 📜 Rules 
Clicking a box causes a kitten to appear.  
Collect several kittens and call the mother cat.  
Determine the mother's primary color.  
Click one of the kittens of the same color.  
If the colors match, the kittens with the same primary color will go with their mother—the family is reunited!

### 🤔 Problems 
The game has some bugs, but you can still enjoy it.
I need to add
- proper scoring,
- visual effects,
- polished ending.
